### Description

This code will load 2 excel files into grid controls and compare the contents and show the differences both by highlighting the cells in grid controls and also by listing the different cells in a third grid.
 
### More Info
 
select each file to compare (I attached 2 different excel files as an example).

The Original example for loading excel into a grid control is at :

http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=61399&amp;lngWId=1

and was submitted by Cristiano Couto.

I modified it to open 2 excel files and compare each cell.

shows the differences

less aggravation when sorting through the many versions of the same excel file.
